            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the Å¿tate of the Fort (notwithÅ¿tanding Å¿ome Å¿mall reliefe they lately had obtayned) is Å¿uch that in the iudgement of man, it cannot hold out many dayes, for Å¿ince they haue receiued Å¿ome reliefe, there hath come forth daily by twenties more or leÅ¿Å¿e, poore hunger-Å¿tarued people, which doth demonÅ¿trate the Å¿tate of the reÅ¿t, hauing had (as they report) only a
<pb facs="tcp:177233:3"/>poore pittance of Bread and Water, for a moneth or fiue weekes together, inÅ¿omuch, that the number in the Fort which they haue remayning for defence, is come from two thouÅ¿and and odde to fiue hundred, and that of late about two dayes before the comming away of this MeÅ¿Å¿enger, a Dutchman comming out of the Fort, and did deliuer to my Lord Duke the Å¿trength of the Fort, and where they were beÅ¿t prouided for defence, what places were weakeÅ¿t, and not able to defend the leaÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ault, Å¿hould bee made againÅ¿t them. For in reaÅ¿on, if we conÅ¿ider the compaÅ¿Å¿e of the Fort) being about a mile) the beÅ¿ieged with that number of men cannot mayntaine each worke, with enterchange of freÅ¿h men, as the neceÅ¿Å¿itie of the Å¿iege will require, by which you may gather that they cannot long Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t. BeÅ¿ides my Lord hath taken and doth poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e, two of the principall out-workes of the Enemie, by which they are able to diÅ¿mount the greateÅ¿t part of their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and in Å¿hort time to command Å¿ome other of their beÅ¿t workes, and to giue law vnto them in their owne tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Vpon which conÅ¿ideration, together with other infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation receiued, my Lord called a Councell, and did thereupon reÅ¿olue to aÅ¿Å¿aile them in places of beÅ¿t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, which was to be put in execution immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the comming away of this MeÅ¿Å¿enger, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (as this MeÅ¿Å¿enger reports) of a happie IÅ¿Å¿ue, and that the Fort before this is in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the EngliÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>For the further hope of reliefe which they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the Mayne, my Lord hath taken Å¿uch care, and hath from Rochell receiued diuers flat bottome
<pb facs="tcp:177233:4"/>Boates, which are Å¿o linked and chainted together by art, that now it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible that any Å¿uccour Å¿hould be brought in, in the night, as formerly hath beene; now, whereas Å¿ome may obiect againÅ¿t my Lords care in Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Fort thus at Å¿euerall times to be relieued, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer, that it is not poÅ¿Å¿ible, neither could the wit of man preuent the Å¿ame, if they will venture at all times, and hazard themÅ¿elues, but that Å¿ome of many may Å¿cape in, with Å¿ome Å¿mall prouiÅ¿ion, vnleÅ¿Å¿e wee could guard the Å¿hoare with a Å¿ufficient number of Boates aÅ¿well night, as day, to preuent which they haue now made a Barracado; as aforeÅ¿aid.</p>
            <p>The French King did lately Å¿end a MeÅ¿Å¿enger to my Lord to require a faire quarter to bee obÅ¿erued by his Excellency, &amp; did promiÅ¿e the like Å¿hould be obÅ¿erued on his part, wherunto my Lord Å¿ent him this anÅ¿wer, that for his part he would obÅ¿erue all farre quarters with his MaieÅ¿tie by land; but by water, he deÅ¿ired him to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and Å¿ayd, that by water it might diÅ¿aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him, and therefore would keepe no other quarters then he had done hitherto, and which by the Law of Armes he might iuÅ¿tifie with his Honour.</p>
            <p>The French King lying with his Armie before Rochell is verie Å¿icke, and doth Å¿uffer much in his Army by Å¿euerall caÅ¿ualties: the new Fort which hee hath lately erected, is much demoliÅ¿hed, and diuerÅ¿e workes belonging to it taken by the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chellers, beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e of Rochell are building another Fort againÅ¿t it, which will be a great annoyance to the Kings Armie.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Rohan is marching to the ayd of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell with 7000. Foot and 500. HorÅ¿e well prouided
<pb facs="tcp:177233:4"/>and reÅ¿olute Souldiers. In Lorraine, a BiÅ¿hop of that Dukedome hath in readineÅ¿Å¿e 15000. men, which as it is Å¿ayd, are prouided, and haue a purpoÅ¿e to fall vpon Å¿ome parts of the French Kings Dominions, and that the quarrell Å¿hould be the HouÅ¿e of AuÅ¿tria's, beÅ¿ides Å¿ome other Princes are preparing to inuade him likewiÅ¿e, which will giue the French King his hands full.</p>
            <p>My L. Duke and his whole Armie are couragious and in good eÅ¿tate, he hath receiued lately fiue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from Rochell of braue reÅ¿olute fellowes, and hath Å¿ent into Rochell all his Å¿icke and hurt men, where they are well releeued of all neceÅ¿Å¿aries.</p>
            <p>The Rochellers haue wholly declared themÅ¿elues for the King of England, as by the Articles which are agreed vpon by my L. Duke and them doth appeare, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie hath Å¿ent word to his MaieÅ¿tie, that if it pleaÅ¿e him to Å¿end him bread, he will deÅ¿erue it, but if he will adde vnto it Å¿omewhat more he will drinke his health; by which you may Å¿ee his inuincible courage, zeale and affection to his Countries Honour, which I pray God to proÅ¿per.</p>
            <p>Since this MeÅ¿Å¿enger came, one MaÅ¿ter <hi>Griffin,</hi> a Gentle-man belonging to his Excellencie, arriued in London on Sunday night (who being longer at Å¿ea) yet was diÅ¿patcht away before this Dutch-man 12. daies, &amp; doth confirme what this MeÅ¿Å¿enger brought, only it was his misfortune to arriue after him, being croÅ¿t by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie winds, and the Barke in which hee came in being caÅ¿t away, and onely himÅ¿elfe and his fellow-paÅ¿Å¿engers were Å¿aued by the mercie of God, together with thoÅ¿e packets and other matters of worth, which they had in

               <p>On the 26 of this Moneth is his Imperiall MaieÅ¿tie with the EmpreÅ¿Å¿e, the King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and both his daughters, beÅ¿ides many of his Courtiers, gone from hence towards <hi>Prage.</hi> The Prince his yongeÅ¿t Sonne, and the Archduke <hi>Leopoldus</hi> tarrie here.</p>
               <p>His Imperiall MaieÅ¿tie and all them which are gone with him, are to day to keepe at <hi>Nicholas burg</hi> in the houÅ¿e of the Cardinall of <hi>DidrichÅ¿tein</hi> the feaÅ¿t of Saint <hi>Michael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>Iulius Fredericke</hi> of <hi>Wirtenburg</hi> is here daily expected. But it is thought that Å¿eeing that the Emperor is departed that he will reÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe here Å¿ome dayes, and goe afterwards to the Emperor.</p>
               <p>To day is expired the time which was prefixed to the ProteÅ¿tant Preachers for their departure. But Å¿eeing that the raine-water, and otherwaters which haue drowned the Land, haue much Å¿poiled the high-wayes, that they cannot well be vÅ¿ed, they haue at their requeÅ¿t obtained leaue to tarry in this Land Å¿ome few weekes to diÅ¿poÅ¿e in the interim of their affayres, and meanes. They are to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ake this land before expiration of three weekes, vpon paine to be Å¿euerely puniÅ¿hed.</p>
               <p>It is here rumored by many, but belieued by very few, that there a peace concluded betwixt the Emperour and the great Signior for the Å¿pace of 25. yeares.</p>
               <p>Herewith I Å¿end the Imperiall Proclamation which hath in this Court by the Clergie beene obtained, and beene printed, and affixed two dayes agoe, and likewiÅ¿e beene Å¿ent to diuers other places, by which is commanded that the Preachers, and Schoole-maÅ¿ters which are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tants Å¿hall forÅ¿ake the Land of <hi>Over-Ens</hi> within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time which is prefixed, and that the exerciÅ¿e of their religion Å¿hall neuer any more there be Å¿uffered.</p>

               <p>On the firÅ¿t of September went the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to Å¿ee and to view our walls, and all our Å¿conces, and works round about this City, and eÅ¿pecially the new raiÅ¿ed Å¿conce, which the Å¿ouldiers cal commonly <hi>Schenke-Å¿conce,</hi> by reaÅ¿on of the Å¿trength of it: and at the Å¿ame time there were 44 peeces of ordnance diÅ¿charged, beÅ¿ides many muskets both by water and land.

And it happened that about the Å¿ame time, that a Galley of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> being put to Sea to try whether it could well Å¿ayle, it encountred with a SwediÅ¿h Å¿hip, and had a pretty combat both with it, and 3 other for a little while, which were afterwards cruelly battered by our ordnance which lay in a Å¿conce neere which the SwediÅ¿h followed the Å¿aid Gally.
